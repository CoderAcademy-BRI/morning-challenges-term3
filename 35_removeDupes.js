/*
Remove Dupes TDD

This is a TDD challenge. Write the tests first.

Try doing this without Google.
Use a .forEach loop and .includes to solve the problem.

Syntax help: [1,2,3].includes(1) -> true, [1,2,3].includes(4) -> false

removeDupes should take an array of strings, remove duplicates and
return a new array.

1. Look up previous challenges and use their tests as a starting point
to get started
2. Write some tests for removeDupes. They should fail.
3. Implement removeDupes, run your tests to check they pass.

Beast mode:
1. Create a new folder called tests and inside of it create a file
   called 35_removeDupes_test.js. Move your tests here and ensure
   your code can still be tested.

2. Following the TDD, update removeDupes to work for numbers too.
    E.g. "1" and 1 should be treated as different values
